This project was implemented using quite a few tutorials! The tutorials used are below. 

* Responsive sidebar: https://www.skeleton.dev/blog/how-to-implement-a-responsive-sidebar-drawer

* Dark Mode Toggle: https://www.skeleton.dev/docs/dark-mode 

* I noticed that the AppShell feature in the "responsive sidebar" is deprecated. Instead, it's recommended to use the skeleton layout system. 
* * Layout system used: https://next.skeleton.dev/docs/get-started/layouts
